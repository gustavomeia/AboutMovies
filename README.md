Platform using C#.

- [Newtonsoft.Json](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json): Popular high-performance JSON framework for .NET. Used in this project to 
parse the API responses.

- [Prism](http://prismlibrary.github.io/): A framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications
